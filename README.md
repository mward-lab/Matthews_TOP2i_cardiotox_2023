# Cardiotoxicity

A [workflowr](https://github.com/workflowr/workflowr) project started by E. Renee Matthews

This is a workflowr project covering the results of testing a panel of chemotherapy drugs that were tested on a set of six geneotyped iPSC-cell lines.  Each cell line was differentiated into cardiomyocytes and exposed to the drugs at a range of concentrations for periods of time ranging from 3 hours to 48 hours.
