# Figure 1

Top2i drugs affect cardiomyocyte viability in a dose dependent manner.

## A. Project Overview

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("output/Fig_summary1.png",error=FALSE)

knitr::include_graphics("output/plan2plot.png",error=FALSE)

knitr::include_graphics("individual-legenddark2.png",error=FALSE)
```

things to note about this image so far: Need to import into illustrator. Goal is to have colors changes on Drugs from sick purple and jaundice yellow, to a red tone and a blue tone for non-ACs. I also want to change to add a time line of treatment.

## B. Example Dose response curves from 48 hour drug exposure.

Lines are a log-logistic regression of the mean from quadruplicates at 8 separate concentrations for each condition, except (trastuzmab)TRZ, which is 7 concentrations.
