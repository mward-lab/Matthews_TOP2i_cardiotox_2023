# Figure 1

Top2i drugs affect cardiomyocyte viability in a dose dependent manner.

## A. Project Overview

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("output/Fig_summary1.png")
```

things to note about this image so far:  Need to import into illustrator.  Goal is to have colors changes on Drugs from sick purple and jaudice yellow, to a red tone and a blue tone for non-ACs.  I also want to change to add a time line of treatment.


## B. Example Dose response curves from 48 hour drug exposure. Lines are a log-logistic regression of the mean from quadriplicates at 8 seperate concentrations for each condition, except (trastuzmab)TRZ, which is 7 concentrations.
