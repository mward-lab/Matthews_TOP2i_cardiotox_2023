Welcome to my research website. I am using workflowr to create reproducible code and data analysis.  

# On my way.

Click on this [link](https://reneeisnowhere.github.io/Cardiotoxicity/run_all_analysis.html) to see my results from the full run!!!   

The cormotif analysis is here: [link](https://reneeisnowhere.github.io/Cardiotoxicity/Cormotifcluster_analysis.html)

Click on this [link](https://reneeisnowhere.github.io/Cardiotoxicity/RNAseqanalysis.html) to see my results from the first analysis 

You can also look at my page of GO analysis.  This page will eventually contain all my Gene Enrichment analysis.
