Welcome to my research website. I am using workflowr to create reproducible code and data analysis.  

# Everyday is a new adventure.  

  

Click on this [link](https://reneeisnowhere.github.io/Cardiotoxicity/RNAseqrun_1_analysis.html) to see my results from the first analysis so far! Fair warning, it is a mess of code!


You can also look at my __NEW__ page of analysis.  This page will eventually contain all my Gene Enrichment analysis.[GSEA analysis]https://reneeisnowhere.github.io/Cardiotoxicity/GO_analysis.html
